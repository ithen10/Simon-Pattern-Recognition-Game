# Simon-Pattern-Recognition-Game
My teammate, Simon, and I made this as our final project for ECE 312: Embedded Systems Design in 2018. The goal of the game is to memorize a pattern made by a series of lights and mimic it. The series of lights increases by 1 with each successful turn. At the end of the game, the user's score is recorded and compared to with a high score. A pseudo-random pattern is generated each time for a new user. Atmel Studio was used with C language.

# My contributions:
Wrote 2/3 of the code with emphasis on the pseudo-random pattern generator functions and gameplay mechanics. Debugged the code to ensure smooth and interactive gameplay. Organized the wires and the hardware components so that it looks neat and is convenient for the user.

# What I learned:
Generating a pseudo-random seed using clock and user input, and learning how to work against the clock to finish it within a week.
